- A **non-profit organization**

### Commercial License

Organizations exceeding the small business threshold need a commercial license.

## Commercial Licensing

### Philosophy

I believe in sustainable open source. Commercial licensing from larger organizations funds continued development, bug fixes, and new features — and eventually it would be nice to hire full time developers if this ever gets there. This keeps Therapy.jl healthy for *everyone*, including the researchers and small teams who use it for free.

I'm not trying to squeeze anyone. Pricing is meant to be fair and proportional.

### Pricing Guidelines

These are starting points, not rigid rules:

| Organization Size | Suggested Annual License |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| $1M – $5M revenue | $1,000 – $3,000 |
| $5M – $25M revenue | $5,000 – $15,000 |
| $25M+ revenue | Let's talk |

**Early adopters, startups, and multi-year commitments get discounts.**

### Get in Touch

Honestly, just email me: **dalejamesblack@gmail.com**

Even if you're not sure whether you need a license, or you're a smaller company that technically qualifies as "small business" but wants to support the project — I'd love to hear from you. 

I'm a PhD student building this ecosystem, not a corporation with a legal department. Every conversation is just a conversation.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm a researcher at a university. Can I use this?**  
A: Yes, completely free. No need to contact me (though I'd love to hear what you're building).

**Q: I'm building an open source project that depends on Therapy.jl. Is that okay?**  
A: Yes, completely free. Open source supports open source.

**Q: I work at a big company but I'm just experimenting personally.**  
A: Personal experimentation and learning is always free. If your company starts using it for business purposes — customer-facing products, internal tools, documentation systems, dashboards, anything that supports business operations — that's when to reach out.

**Q: We're a funded startup but haven't hit $1M revenue yet.**  
A: You're covered under the small business terms. When you grow past that threshold (congrats!), let's chat.

**Q: We're only using it for internal tools, not a product we sell. Do we need a license?**  
A: If your organization exceeds the $1M revenue threshold, yes. Internal tools, dashboards, documentation systems, and developer infrastructure all count as business use. The license isn't about whether your customers see it — it's about whether your business benefits from it.

**Q: What if we can't afford the suggested pricing?**  
A: Email me. I'd rather have you using Therapy.jl with a discounted license than not using it at all. We'll figure something out.

**Q: Can we get an invoice / formal agreement for our legal team?**  
A: Yes, I can provide proper documentation for your records.
